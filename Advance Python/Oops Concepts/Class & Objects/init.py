# Let's Learn about __init__() Method in Python

'''
In Python, __init__() is a special method called a constructor.Constructors are used to initializing the objectâ€™s state.
It is automatically invoked when you create an instance of a class.
This method is typically used to initialize the attributes of a class instance.
So, All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.

# Example
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name,age,address):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.address = address

# Create an instance of Person
p = Person('Anup Karki',23,'Nepal')
print(f'The name of person is {p.name} and he is {p.age} years old he live in {p.address}.')
