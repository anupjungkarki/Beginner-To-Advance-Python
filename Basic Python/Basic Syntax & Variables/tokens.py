Tokens in python are the smallest units of a program that have a meaning. They are the building blocks of a Python program.
There are five types of tokens in Python:
1. Keywords: These are reserved words in Python that have a special meaning. Examples include if, else, while, for, def, return, etc.
2. Identifiers: These are names given to variables, functions, classes, and other user- defined entities.
    They must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_) followed by letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.
3. Literals: These are constant values that are used in a program. 
    Examples include numbers (e.g., 10, 3.14), strings (e.g., "Hello", 'Python'), and boolean values (True, False).
4. Operators : These are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.
    Examples include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, !=, >, <), and logical operators (and, or, not).
5. Delimiters: These are symbols that are used to separate different parts of a program.
    Examples include parentheses (), brackets [], braces {}, commas ,, colons :, and semicolons ;.
