# Lets wrap up what we have learned so far in this section
# by creating a simple program that uses variables and basic syntax.

# Start of the program
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
age = input("Please enter your age: ")
print("Hello, " , name , "! You are " , age , " years old.")
# End of the program
