# Example of eval() function in Python
expression = input("Enter a mathematical expression (e.g., 5+3):")
result = eval(expression)
print("The result of the expression is:", result)

# The eval() function takes a string as input and evaluates it as a Python expression.
# It can be used to perform arithmetic operations, call functions, and more.
# Caution: Be careful when using eval() with untrusted input, as it can execute arbitrary code and pose security risks.
# Always validate or sanitize the input before using eval() in real-world applications.
# For more information on eval() function, please refer to the official Python documentation.
