What is operators in Python?
Operators in Python are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on one or more operands (values or variables).
They are used to carry out various types of computations and manipulations in a program. Python supports several types of operators, including:
1. Arithmetic Operators: Used for mathematical operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), exponentiation (**), and floor division (//).
2. Comparison Operators: Used to compare two values and return a boolean result. Examples include equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).
3. Logical Operators: Used to combine conditional statements. The main logical operators are and, or, and not.
4. Assignment Operators: Used to assign values to variables. Examples include =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, and //=.
5. Bitwise Operators: Used to perform bit-level operations on integers. Examples include AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>).      
6. Membership Operators: Used to test if a value is present in a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string). The operators are in and not in.
7. Identity Operators: Used to compare the memory locations of two objects. The operators are is and is not.        
These operators are fundamental to programming in Python and are used extensively in various applications and algorithms.
